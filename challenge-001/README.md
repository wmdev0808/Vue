# The Complete Guide

## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1. What is Vue.js

- What is Vue.js (or just `Vue`)?

  - Vue.js(Vue) is a `JavaScript` `framework` that makes building interactive and `reative` `web frontends` (= browser-side web applications) easier.

    - `JavaScript`

      - A programming language that is supported by all browsers. It allows you to manipulate the already-running page and hence provide richer user experiences.

    - `framework`

      - A framework is a (third-party) library that exposes utility functionalities AND a "set of rules" (a clear guidance) on how to build your JavaScript application

    - `reactive`

      - Your app is able to react to user input, update the screen dynamically (e.g. to show overlays or input validation errors) -> Look and feel of mobile apps

    - `web frontends`
      - "What the user sees"
        - HTML + CSS + JavaScript, running in the browser of your user

  - Mobile apps and desktop apps `feel very "reactive"`: Things happen instantly, you `don't wait` for new pages to load or actions to start.

  - Traditionally, in web apps, you click a link and wait for a new page to load. You click a button and wait for some action to complete.

  - JavaScript To The Rescue!

    - JavaScript runs in the browser - on the loaded page.
    - You can manipulate the HTML structure(DOM) of the page.
    - No (visible) request to the server required. no need to wait for a new HTML page as a response.

  - But `Just JavaScript` May Not Be Ideal!
    - You can build ANY kind of web application with just "vanilla" JavaScript
      - No framework like Vue is needed!
    - But
      - You have to write all code on your own (-> re-invent the wheel)
      - You might write suboptimal code or introduce errors & bugs
      - Working in a team might be harder because not everyone knows you structure and "code philosophy"

### 1.2. Different Ways of Using Vue

- Vue can be used to control parts of HTML pages or entire pages.
  - `Widget` approach on a multi-page-application.
    - (Some) pages are still rendered `on and served by a backend server`.
- Vue can also be used to control the entire frontend of a web application
  - `Single-Page-Application`(SPA) approach.
    - Server `only sends one HTML page`, thereafter, Vue takes over and controls the UI.

### 1.3. Exploring Vue Alternatives

- Vue.js

  - Complete component-based UI framework, includes most core features. A bit less popular than React & Angular.

- React.js

  - Lean and focused component-based UI library. Certain features (e.g. routing) are added via community packages.

- Angular
  - Complete component-based UI framework, packed with features. Uses TypeScript. Can be overkill for smaller projects.
